# Significant wave modelling using LSTM and CNN ![waves](wave.png)  ![waves](wave.png)  ![waves](wave.png)
This repos present an example of jupyter notebook for modeling significant wave using data from buoy station.

This models were made using Keras for the neural network part, and there's two notebooks,
one using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) visualization library ([This one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oulebsir-rafik/Wave_modelling/blob/master/HS%20notebook/HS%20modeling%20using%20LSTM%20and%20CNN.ipynb)), but this one need to be runned on locally (because charts don't display in online jupyter notebook viewer). And another notebook that use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and pandas to make charts, that can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oulebsir-rafik/Wave_modelling/blob/master/HS%20notebook%20seaborn%20viz/HS%20modeling%20using%20LSTM%20and%20CNN.ipynb).

Don't forget to download the data in this [link](https://github.com/oulebsir-rafik/Wave_modelling/blob/master/HS%20notebook/All_data_6400045.xlsx)
